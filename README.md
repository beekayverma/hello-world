# hello-world
my first repository to learn GitHub

Hello there, I'm Beekay and I am learning GitHub which will help me to grow professionally. Learning never stops so here is my first repository/file changes with "Commit".

Thanks!! ðŸ˜Š 
I have completed one more chapter for my Cloud Engineer boot camp course. It was about RPM for CentOs/SUSE. I enjoyed it and tomorrow I will learn more.
Never Stop learning!

Today, December 14th 2020, I have completed 7 & 8 chapters of LFS 201 module of Cloud Engineer bootcamp course.
